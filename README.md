Drupal Feeds Content Rewriter
=============================

This project was given to me during my time working at xCubicle as a module for search engine optimization, for which I was allowed to Open Source. It hooks into the Drupal Feeds Module and rewrites the content after the Feeds module finishes grabbing an RSS feed.
